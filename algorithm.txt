the goal of this assignment is to create a simulation of the race between the Tortoise and the Hare
the program will do this through the use of a while loop and advance functions for both the Tortoise and the Hare through the use of a random number generator to act as a probability gage
it will determine how far forward, backward, or if they will move at all through if statements
it will print out the positions of the Tortoise and the Hare through setw functions which will print a T or H a certain amount of spaces depening on where they are.
This will be determined through calculating the distance from the beginning of the race to the person in last the distance between first and last and the distance between first and the finish.
the user will not have to input anything
the output will be a T and a H and a | to represent the end of the race and a bunch of spaces imbetween
